* Purpose
  This library implements universal PID controller class on Arduino platform.
  It is a partial rewrite of Arduino PID Library by Brett Beauregard <br3ttb@gmail.com>.
  What's different:
** Exposed errors
** pid_config struct with all the tuning values
** Deadband and dead interval support
** Improved code readability
* TODO Examples
